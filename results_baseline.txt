## Detailed Analysis

### Context Recall (0.534) - Moderate Performance
- Measures if the system retrieves the right pieces of information from source documents
- System is finding relevant information about half the time
- **Best performing metric** in the evaluation
- Room for significant improvement in retrieval accuracy

### Answer Relevancy (0.597) - Decent Performance
- Evaluates if answers address the user's question
- Second best performing metric
- Responses are generally on-topic
- Could be more focused and precise

### Faithfulness (0.337) - Poor Performance
- Checks if responses adhere to facts from retrieved context
- Concerning performance level
- Potential issues:
  - Making up information not in context
  - Combining information incorrectly
  - Straying from source material

### Factual Correctness (0.207) - Very Poor Performance
- Verifies factual accuracy of generated responses
- Serious issues with accuracy identified
- Root causes may include:
  - Poor context retrieval
  - Incorrect information synthesis
  - LLM hallucination

### Critical Issues

#### Entity Recall (0.011)
- System failing to include important:
  - Named entities
  - Key terms
  - Critical information from context
- Requires immediate attention

#### Noise Sensitivity (0.012)
- System highly affected by irrelevant information
- Poor discrimination between relevant and irrelevant content
- Needs significant improvement in filtering mechanism
